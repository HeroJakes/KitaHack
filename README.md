ðŸ§  Chatbot Configuration
The project requires two key pieces of information to work:

1. API Key â€“ This is likely the key for an AI service (e.g., OpenAI, Google Dialogflow, etc.).

2. API URL/Endpoint â€“ The base URL where requests to the AI model are sent.

These need to be manually set at **chatbot.html file, line 516, and 517.**

ðŸ“± Mobile Compatibility
The UI is optimized for smartphones 

The design (layout, text, buttons) is made to look good and work smoothly on mobile devices.

It might work on desktop too, but itâ€™s best experienced on mobile.
